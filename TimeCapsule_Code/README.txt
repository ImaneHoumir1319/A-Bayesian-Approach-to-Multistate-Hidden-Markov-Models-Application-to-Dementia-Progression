synthetic_MCSA_data.rda has been simulated from a modified version of the script 
file Simulate.r to closely resemble the real MCSA data set.  The real MCSA data set 
is not provided due to HIPAA restrictions.

Transitions_heat_movie.mp4 is a movie to visualize the evolution of the transition 
rates in the state space over all integer ages from 50-90.
